### **Basic Questions**  

1. **What is Logistic Regression?**

2. **Why do we use Logistic Regression instead of Linear Regression for classification?**  
   - Linear Regression is not suitable for classification as it predicts continuous values, while Logistic Regression provides probabilities constrained between 0 and 1.  

3. **When do we use Logistic Regression?**  
   - When the target variable is categorical (e.g., spam detection, medical diagnosis, pass/fail prediction).  

4. **What is the equation of Logistic Regression?**  
   - \( P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_nX_n)}} \)  

5. **What is the role of the sigmoid function in Logistic Regression?**  
   - It maps any real-valued number to a range between 0 and 1, converting linear regression output into probabilities.

7. **How do you handle a dataset with imbalanced classes in Logistic Regression?**  
   - Use techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, class-weight adjustment, or threshold tuning.

   - No multicollinearity, independent observations, and a linear relationship between predictors and the log-odds of the response.  

9. **How do you interpret the coefficients in Logistic Regression?**  
   - The coefficients represent the log-odds change in probability for a unit increase in the predictor variable.  

10. **What is the decision boundary in Logistic Regression?**  
   - It is the threshold (usually 0.5) that separates classes; if \( P(Y=1) > 0.5 \), classify as 1, else 0.
